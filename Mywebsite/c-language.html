       <h2>What is c language?</h2>
        <p>C is a procedural programming language, it was initally developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972.
        it was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system.
        The main features of the C language include low-level memory access, a simple set of keywords,
        and a clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.  </p>
